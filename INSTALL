Installation Instructions
*************************

Prerequisite: hubo-ach (https://github.com/hubo/hubo-ach)

0. This package uses autotools. If you're not sure whether you have autotools, put the following
into the terminal:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf

It also depends on the Eigen C++ Library 3.0. Get it with the following command on Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev

____________________________________________________________

1. Now to use autotools:

In the directory which contains Makefile.am and configure.ac, run the following commands into
the terminal:

$ mkdir m4
(Sometimes there is a complaint about this not existing. If it already exists, then don't worry
about this step.)

$ autoreconf -i
(Give this some time. It can take a while.)

$ ./configure

This should generate a Makefile. You can use 

$ ls

from the terminal to check that "Makefile" exists.

____________________________________________________________

2. Now you're ready to compile. Try the following:

$ make
(If an error occurs here, please contact mxgrey@gatech.edu)

$ sudo make install
(This will make the package system-wide and install the libraries)

____________________________________________________________

3. Everything should be ready to go.

If you try running the software according to the instructions in USAGE and you get something like
the following error:

"libhuboparams.so.x.x.x cannot be found" or "libdaemonizer.so.x.x.x cannot be found"

then the libraries were installed to a directory which is not in your ldconfig path. Feel free to
contact mxgrey@gatech.edu to figure out how to resolve the issue.

4. If any problems not mentioned here occur or if you have any confusion or issues with installation
or compilation whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact the author.
