USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
******************


This package installs an "initialization script" to your System V directory. Without getting into
the nitty-gritty of what that means, there's a shell script which takes care of running everything
for you.

To use it, simply type the following into a terminal:

$ sudo service tech
(The "sudo" is not always necessary, but I find it's better to be safe and include it rather than
confused about why things aren't working as expected)

This will print out a list of commands which it accepts. All of these commands accept a "help"
argument which will tell you what they do in finer detail. For example, typing

$ sudo service tech start help

will print the following help message:

> This will switch all the CAN
> devices to up mode, open all
> ach channels, boot up the
> hubo-daemon, control-daemon,
> and start up the tech-console.
> 
> You can pass in arguments to the
> hubo-daemon by appending them to
> your run.sh start command. Example:
>    sudo ./run.sh start -v -d
> will run the daemon while passing
> in the arguments -v and -d

If you want to use Hubo-Motion-RT, please do NOT run the "hubo-ach" script which comes with
the hubo-ach package. Technically, it shouldn't hurt to use both at the same time, but I haven't
verified this thoroughly yet.

Running "$ sudo service tech start" will open up an instance of "tech-console" which is derived
from the "hubo-console" of hubo-ach. The only difference between the two is that tech-console is
verified to work well with the control-daemon whereas hubo-console does not have the same
guarantees. Eventually tech-console will be replaced with a GUI which will run on a remote computer
(whichever computer you ssh from).

If you have any questions or run into any problems whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact

For examples of applications which use and link to the Hubo-Motion-RT, please see

on how to use the API to make your own daemons and controllers.
